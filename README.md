DelaunayTriangulation
=====================

DelaunayTriangulations for the Randomized Algorithms course

This repository contains several projects and solutions. Some are more important than others. 
Here we give a quick overview of the projects.

The Algorithms package is presumably the most important as it contains both the Chew and the Guibas implementation for 
the Delaunay Triangulation. The Algorithms package relies heavily on the GeoLib package for several Geometrical Objects.
The GeoPolygon is especially important for the Chew algorithm, since it relies on convex polygons.
The GeoView package is useful for the visualization of these objects. In addition we should note that we have borrowed 
the Matrix.cs file as well.

Within the MyBlankSolution folder is the Visualization project which has a simple form that shows result of the Guibas 
implementation.
